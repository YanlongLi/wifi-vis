![cur version](_img/0204-img-1.png)

(records data is on day of 2013-09-02, Monday)

- 283876 records on 250 APs
- number of access to one AP is between [13,4512].
		2/3 is below 1500.
		when generate path for a device(MAC address),
		only one of neighbouring records on same AP is reserved.
- among 250 APs, there are 2549 links, the weigh of link is between [1,641], which represent how many path on this link. most of these number is below 50.

What update:

- Rewrite and simplify the implementation
-	Add color to Floor Nav bar
- Add AP Graph to show aps relationship

Still many problems:

- Some Aps share the some position
	```
	3,f1ap1,0,0,1
	2,f1ap2,0,0,1
	7,f1ap3,0,0,1
	4,f1ap4,0,0,1
	```
- Path direction haven't been shown up both in Floor Plan and AP Graph
- In th AP Graph, nodes and links are clustered. May nodes and links should be filtered.
- How to generate a reasonable path using wifi records?
- Other infomation?

Todo next:

- Seperate different directon of path
